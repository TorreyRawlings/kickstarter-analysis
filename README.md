# Kickstarter-Analysis
#### The purpose of this project is to provide data to Louise to determine trends in creating a successful kickstarter.


### Analysis and Challenges
  I was able to section this data through excel by using several functions to better filter what data was relevant to our cause. Graphs were created to better visualize the details behind these kickstarters. We were able to create a graps on the theater outcomes based on launched date. We also created a graph showing the outcomes of 'play' kickstarters based on goals. (See below). The challenges we faced were determining which information was most relevant to Louise to create a successful kickstarter. There was a lot of details provided and it was easy to get lost in the data. The end decision was to use the graphs seen below to help Louise set better expectations and parameters so that her kickstarter campaign goes well. (Detailed data file can be viewed [here](https://github.com/TorreyRawlings/kickstarter-analysis.git)).

 #### After reviewing the Theater Outcomes Based on Launched Date we came to the following conclusions:
  - December is not an ideal month to begin a kickstarter campaign. 
  - Summer months have the highest success rate of kickstarter campaigns.

### Outcomes of 'Play' Kickstarters by Goal

 #### After reviewing the Outcomes of 'Play' Kickstarters by Goal we came to the following conclusions: 
  - Kickstarter campaigns that have a goal of $40,000 or more have a significantly higher chance of failing.

### Limitations to our Analysis
While a lot of data is provided the following should be kept in mind when reviewing data:
- We do not know how these kickstarters were campaigned. Was it word of mouth? Online? Was social media used? This information would be useful in knowing the most successful ways to campaign and what should be avoided. When collecting future data this should be gathered and stored so a chart can be made with the outcomes and the types of campaigns.
- Only the country is provided, not the city. There may be more success in specific parts of each country. This would be helpful in a chart as well with the average donation or the pledged amount. With this information we could plan a better location to start the campaign.
